# Bluetick

**Discord Bot and Bot Admin Manager - Web Application**

## TL;DR

This is a personal project aiming to ease Discord server owners and admins in server managing tasks with entertainment-related features.

## How it all started

Bluetick originated from my desire to create a Discord bot for my server, where my friends and I could enjoy entertainment and engage in casual conversations. Inspired by bots managing gaming servers, I started with a simple bot with Python using the [nextcord](https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord) library.

As the bot grew with new features based on feedback from my group of over 50 active users, I transitioned to the more actively maintained DiscordJS library to keep up with the Discord API updates. However, JavaScript's unpredictable errors proved challenging, leading me to migrate to **TypeScript**, a decision I've never regretted.

### Why we need a website/platform

With the bot's expanding feature set, managing everything through Discord commands became increasingly complex and tedious. Drawing inspiration from well-established bots like [Dyno](https://dyno.gg/), which had a dedicated website for comprehensive control, I recognized the need for a dedicated web application to streamline bot management across multiple servers.

### The development process

Bluetick evolved into a full-fledged web application built with modern technologies like **Next.js**, **NextAuth**, **tailwindcss**, **shadcn/ui**, and **TypeScript** for the frontend, complemented by **NestJS**, **TypeScript**, and **Rust** for the backend.

The development journey involved iterative phases, including initially using **React** and **Material-UI** for the frontend, before migrating to **Next.js** with **tailwindcss** and **shadcn/ui** for more customizable UI components. The bot's features grew based on current user requests and popular features from other bots that I wanted to develop myself.

### The name

Why Bluetick? Bluetick's name is a combination of my Discord username, **blue** and its core feature: creating tickets within Discord servers. These tickets are dedicated channels or threads tailored to serve various purposes based on each server's unique needs, such as customer support, user support for gaming servers, or application processes for joining gaming groups, all with just a click of a button.

### The product

Bluetick now provides Discord server owners and admins with a user-friendly platform to manage their servers and enjoy a range of entertainment-related features, combining a robust Discord bot with a feature-rich web application.
